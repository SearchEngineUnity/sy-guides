          This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which Sunny Guides, a subsidiary website of{' '}
          <a href="https://techboomers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            Techboomers Media Inc.
          </a>
          , collects, uses, maintains, and discloses information collected from users (each, a
          &quot;User&quot;) of the{' '}

        <h2>Our outlook on privacy</h2>
        <p>
          Everything in this privacy policy should be easy to understand for any user. We will never
          use legal jargon to confuse you out of understanding what our policies on privacy are.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to your data, we simply aren’t interested in selling, trading, or renting
          it, or doing anything with it that you wouldn’t do. When it comes to websites, cookies
          track you as a user so they can remember you when you return. It allows websites to tailor
          the experience to you as a user. Some websites utilize this to sell you things, customize
          your ad experience, or show you content you’re likely more interested in — among other
          reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our website contains no ads, nor do we have anything to sell you. A reason Sunny Guides
          might use cookies would be if you select “English” as your language before entering the
          site, our website can then remember this the next time you return, so you don’t have to
          select it again.

        <p>Here is the more specific information about what our site does related to privacy:</p>
        <h2>Personal identification information</h2>
        <p>
          We may collect personal identification information from Users in a variety of ways,
          including, but not limited to, when Users visit our site, register on the site, fill out a
          form, respond to a survey, and in connection with other activities, services, features or
          resources we make available on our Site.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users may be asked for, as appropriate, name, and/or email address. Users may, however,
          visit our Site anonymously. We will collect personal identification information from Users
          only if they voluntarily submit such information to us. Users can always refuse to supply
          personal identification information, except that it may prevent them from engaging in
          certain Site-related activities.
        </p>
        <h2>Non-personal identification information</h2>
        <p>
          We may collect non-personal identification information about Users whenever they interact
          with our Site. Non-personal identification information may include the browser name, the
          type of computer and technical information about Users&apos; means of connection to our
          Site, such as the operating system, the Internet service providers utilized, and other
          similar information.
        </p>
        <h2>Web browser cookies</h2>
        <p>
          Our Site may use &quot;cookies&quot; to enhance User experience. A User&apos;s web browser
          places cookies on their hard drive for record-keeping purposes, and sometimes to track
          information about them. A User may choose to set their web browser to refuse cookies, or
          to alert you when cookies are being sent. If they do so, note that some parts of the Site
          may not function properly.

        <h2>How we use collected information</h2>
        <p>
          Sunny Guides may collect and use Users&apos; personal information for the following
          purposes:
        </p>
        <h3>To run and operate our Site</h3>
        <p>We may need your information to display content on the Site correctly.</p>
        <h3>To improve customer service</h3>
        <p>
          Information you provide helps us respond to your customer service requests and support
          needs more efficiently.
        </p>
        <h3>To personalize user experience</h3>
        <p>
          We may use information in the aggregate to understand how our Users as a group use the
          services and resources provided on our Site.
        </p>
        <h3>To improve our Site</h3>
        <p>We may use feedback you provide to improve our products and services.</p>
        <h3>To send periodic emails</h3>
        <p>
          We may use the email address to send User information and updates pertaining to their
          order. It may also be used to respond to their inquiries, questions, and/or other
          requests. This is only in the case that the User has freely provided this information to
          us.
        </p>
        <h3>To track website analytics</h3>
        <p>
          We use Google Analytics to see who is coming to the Site, primarily to learn about how
          Users found it so we can optimize all our pages to help other people find it as well.
          Google Analytics requires the use of cookies to provide the information we require.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google&apos;s cookies are anonymized, and contain no identifiable information about you
          such as your name, email address, phone number, etc. We only use Google to track analytics
          to improve our Site for all Users, and never to try to identify individuals — which is not
          possible.
        </p>
        <p>
